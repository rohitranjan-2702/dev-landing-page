# 🙌 Welcome to Dev Landing Page

- As we all prefer open-source software for our daily use, it can be difficult to find tools that are specific to our needs. This is where **Dev Landing Page** comes in.

- Dev Landing Page is a Modern UI Portfolio used to display your projects and share them with the World.

- We all spend hours and weeks creating our own personal Portfolio. Now with Dev Landing Page, it's a few code lines away.

- Although Dev Landing Page is your stop for your personal portfolio, we recognize that it is still evolving. It will take time for us to add all the projects, resources and additional content that our users want.

- That's why, we encourage contributions from everyone interested in making Dev Landing Page even more attractive and useful.

# 🚀 About

- If you're a developer or a tech enthusiast, you can help us create a better experience for everyone.

- Dev Landing Page is more than just a tool to create your portfolio. It's also a treasure of useful skills and projects that can help you in many ways.

- For example, we have curated a list of skill sections which allows you to display a wide range of projects depending on your tech stack.

- But that's not all – we have big plans for the future. We are working hard to add more useful content that can make your life easier and more productive.
- Stay tuned for updates!
